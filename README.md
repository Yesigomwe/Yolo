# Yolo
 This repository contains my solution to the test questions for the QA Engineering role at Yolo Group.

## Steps on how to test
* Clone the repository on your local computer from [Github](https://github.com/Yesigomwe/Yolo).
* Open the directory with the cloned project with VS Code.
* Open terminal at the directory level (If using Windows, use CMD or Terminal for windows. You can also open it through the VS Code Application.)
* Run the command `npx cypress open`.
* Click E2E Testing and wait to initialize.
* Select Browser and click button `Start E2E Testing in [Selected Browser]`

### Tasks 3 and 4
* To Run tests for Task 3, select `roulette.cy.js` spec.
* To Run tests for Task 4, select `apiTests.cy.js` spec.

### NOTE
For Task 4, the tests for DELETE will pass if you use a new and existing user_id. If the user_id has been deleted already or didn't exist before the test will fail.

### Tasks 1 and 2
* The solution for task 1 is found in Issues section on Github.
* The solution for task 2 is a file named Yolo Group Test Plan - Blackjack Classic. This can also be accessed with this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dGhNAGMJcgg-5HgU3I8fZpznQk7wQiRgNGBOqBT4_iA/edit?usp=sharing).
